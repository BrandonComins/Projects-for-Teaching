Prompt:

Make a calculator through the terminal that will ask the user for 2 numbers and a sign.
The calculator will then calculate the appropiate value.
The calculator will repeat this process until the user inputs 'x' or 'X' for the operator
-which will exit the calculator.
You will need to have these operators: +, -, /, *, %, !, ^.
For each operator -except for power- you must make a non-void function.
You may use Math.pow() for power.
